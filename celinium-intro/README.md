# The brief

The objective was to automate the actions of a user filling in a form on a web page using a program called Selenium.

# How I went about it

I had to created many constants that had the value of HTML attributes and then use instance methods to select elements on the page and perform basic actions such as enter text into a form, click a button or scroll down a list of things.

# How to run the programme

Enter the Selinium-intro directory and run the following command: ruby selenium_class_intro.rb'

Here is a cheatsheet for Selenium: https://gist.github.com/huangzhichong/3284966
