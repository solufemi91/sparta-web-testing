## What was required?

I had to test four different scenarios regarding the functionality of the bbc website: an unsuccessful login, a successful login, successful sign up and a unsuccessful signup

## What i struggled with?

I struggled to click either the 'yes please' button or the 'no thanks' button and as a result I was not able to complete a successful login.

I also struggled to implement the after all catcher to ensure that after each spec file is executed that the page went back to an un-logged home page. This meant that all my test couldnt not run properly one after the other.
